# Transformers for Knowledge Tracing: Analyzing the EdNet Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for **COMP 541** by Vincent Verdugo and Monitha Davuluri. The project explores the application of **Transformers** for **Knowledge Tracing**, using the **EdNet Dataset**. Knowledge tracing is the task of modeling a student's evolving knowledge state based on their interaction data, and our work aims to demonstrate the efficacy of Transformer models in this domain.

## Contents

### 1. Code
- **Model Implementation**: Code for building and training Transformer-based models for knowledge tracing.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for preparing the EdNet dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Functions to assess the model's performance on various metrics.

### 2. Datasets
- The **EdNet dataset** contains about 131 million rows, where each row is a single student interaction across multiple abstraction levels, with the KT1 subset used for our project.
- Preprocessed versions of the dataset are also available in the repository under the folder **data**.

### 3. Models
- The folder **groupprojectassignment4** contains the code for models used in this project.
- We used BERT, DistilBert, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks to train the dataset.


### 4. Saved Models
- Trained Transformer models for knowledge tracing are provided.
- Use these models to reproduce results or for further experimentation.
